# BADE-A-New-Strategy-Based-on-BA-Topological-Structure-to-Improve-DE-Algorithm-
Differential Evolution algorithm is an efficient meta-heuristic algorithm, which is highly attractive in the face of practical problems. In the original DE algorithm and its corresponding improved algorithm, all the particles in the process of mutation are treated equally and chosen randomly, while the influence of the topological relation between individuals on the mutation and its subsequent optimization is neglected. In the BADE strategy proposed in this paper, the connection between all individuals will follow the BA scale-free network. In the process of mutation of each individual in each generation of DE, the three individuals required to produce new individuals will no longer be generated by the random equal probability in the rest of the individuals except the ontology; in contrast, only the remaining individuals connected to the ontology are likely to be selected as the mutation factors of the new individuals in each generation process of a new individual. Compared with previous DE algorithm and its typical improved variants, corresponding improved algorithms using BADE strategy, converge more rapidly and more reliably in most test functions. In other test cases this new strategy is also quite competitive.
